<P>One type of blue deck is a "Big Blue" deck, which uses a lot of blue creatures with flying, Counterspells, and some red direct damage (notably Earthquake). It tries to win a medium-length game and can use its direct damage both to get rid of creatures and to finish off the opponent.<BR>
You can also build a mono-blue control deck. The deck uses a <I>huge</I> amount of counterspelling and some card drawing, plus some cards like Boomerang to get rid of opposing permanents once they hit the table</P>
