<P>The greatest strength of Pyrotechnics is its extreme flexibility. For instance, you could deal 2 damage to one creature, 1 damage to another, and 1 damage to your opponent. Because you can split the damage, you may be able to kill several creatures with it, and because of the option of directing some of the damage to your opponent, you know that none of it will ever go to waste.</P>
