<P>Abyssal Hunter is similar to Prodigal Sorcerer in that it taps to kill creatures. The Hunter costs more than the Sorcerer, but it can also kill more creatures--any creature whose power is at least as great as its toughness. And the creatures it can't kill, it can tap! The Hunter does have one drawback (in addition to its cost), though: it can't tap to deal damage to a player.<BR>
As you become a more advanced player, you'll want to start comparing cards in this manner. Sometimes, when you compare two cards, the choice will be clear. In other cases, like this one, it won't. But you do want to start thinking about it.</P>
