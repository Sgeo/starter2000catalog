<P>The trouble with Regeneration is that there are a lot of effects you can't regenerate from! If your opponent plays Terror on your creature, a Regeneration won't do you any good. For this reason, it isn't worth playing a card just to add the regeneration ability to one of your creatures. Creatures with the regeneration ability already on them, such as River Boa, are a different story. Regeneration is a great ability when it's part of the creature; it's just not worth spending a card to gain it.</P>
