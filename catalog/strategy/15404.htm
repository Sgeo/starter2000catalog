<P>There have been very few deck types to date that rely heavily on activated creature abilities. As a consequence, Cursed Totem hasn't been very popular. But keep your eyes open! If your kid brother starts beating up on you with a deck that depends on regeneration, tapping to deal damage, creatures that can sacrifice themselves, and the like, you might try throwing a Totem or two into whatever deck you're playing. If your brother's creature abilities are vital for what he's trying to do, the Totem will be a major problem for him.</P>
