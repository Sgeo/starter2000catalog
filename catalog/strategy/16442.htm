<P>Avoid the trap of underestimating 1/1 creatures that cost one mana. They may be small, but they come out on the first turn. If your deck is going to use big creatures to kill your opponent on turn eight, but your opponent's deck uses small creatures to kill you on turn six, your opponent wins! Small creatures with evasion abilities, such as mountainwalk, are particularly useful; if your opponent is playing red, a creature with mountainwalk will continue dealing damage even after the big creatures come out.</P>
