<P>If you play Wand of Denial, remember that you're not denying your opponent draws. What you're doing is substituting cards you don't see for some of the cards he or she would otherwise have drawn. Because you have to pay life to do this, it isn't going to be worth it against a swarm deck; against a control deck, where the life payment isn't much of a problem, the Wand might well be worthwhile.</P>
