<P>For just two blue mana, Counterspell counters any spell! This makes it one of the defining cards of the game. Decks that use a lot of counterspelling are called "permission" decks; they're often very powerful but can also by tricky to play. When you're playing a permission deck, you don't just use those cards at the first opportunity; instead, save them for the spells that are most important. This is the tricky part, because what's important and what isn't may not be apparent at first.</P>
