<P>The best thing to do with a Forget is to not put it in your deck! If you must play the card, however, you might want to play it when your opponent's hand is empty, so you can discard two cards you don't currently need and draw two cards that might help you. Your opponent, with an empty hand, won't get this benefit.</P>
