<hr>
<P>Dry Spell is better than it looks. A lot of people use a lot of 1-toughness creatures, so Dry Spell may kill many of them. Another ploy you might use is to attack with your creatures before playing Dry Spell. Your opponent may use a creature with 3 toughness to block a creature with 2 power, for instance, and then after combat, the Dry Spell will kill the blocker.</P>
