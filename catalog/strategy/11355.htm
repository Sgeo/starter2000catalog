<P>The ability to redirect damage from your creatures to yourself is better than it might sound. A Jade Monolith can "save" several of your creatures, allowing you to use them against your opponent. In a Sealed-Deck game, you should be delighted to include one in your deck. Another trick is to combine the Monolith with a card such as a Circle of Protection; after redirecting the damage to yourself, you can use the Circle to prevent it altogether.</P>
