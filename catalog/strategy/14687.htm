<P>At first sight, Stream of Life might look comparable to Blaze. In reality, it's much weaker. The biggest reason is flexibility. You can play Blaze on creatures or players, but you can play Stream of Life only on yourself. The defensive nature of the Stream is also a problem. Because you don't know how much damage your opponent is in a position to deal to you, you won't know when it's best to play your Stream. If your opponent can deal more damage than you expect, you might die with the Stream still in your hand. But if your opponent can deal less than you think, you might end up playing a Stream when you could have waited, thereby gaining less life than the optimum amount.</P>
