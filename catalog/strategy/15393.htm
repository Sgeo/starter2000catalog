<P>The ability to get the card you need is great. Vampiric Tutor makes you pay a considerable price, though: you have to pay one mana and 2 life and give up a card. This is probably worth it if your deck relies on card combinations, because if you have part of an important combination, getting another part of the combination can be worth a lot. If your deck doesn't rely on combinations, though (if it's a fast creature deck, for instance), you're better off without the Tutors; just put in more cards that directly help the deck do whatever it's supposed to do.</P>
