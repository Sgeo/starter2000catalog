<P>If your deck consists primarily of small creatures, a single Necrosavant can put you in a powerful position in the endgame. If your opponent counters your Necrosavant or kills it somehow, it doesn't matter much, because you can exchange one of your small creatures for it during your next upkeep.</P>
