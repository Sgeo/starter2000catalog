<P>Sengir Autocrat could be worth playing if you have a good use for the token creatures it generates, such as Hecatomb or Skull Catapult. It might also work if your deck contains some way to make all your creatures stronger--three 0/1 tokens may not be very valuable, but if they become 1/1, 1/2, or 2/1, it's a different story!</P>
