<P>Amber Prison enables you to "lock down" one of your opponent's permanents so that it remains tapped, which usually means it can't do anything. The Prison's flexibility is a plus. You can use it to lock down a threatening creature, and later, if the creature is killed, you can switch over to locking down another creature or a land. Also, if your opponent plays a card that's more threatening that whatever you're currently locking down, you have the option to untap the Prison and switch targets.</P>
