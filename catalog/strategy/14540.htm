<P>Unblockable creatures are a way to break a stalemate. The win may be slow, but they deal damage turn after turn after turn. They can be a particularly good choice for the "top end" creatures in a swarm deck; sometimes, when your opponent tries to stabilize, a couple of unblockable creatures will push him or her over the edge.</P>
