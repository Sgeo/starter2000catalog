<P>Blighted Shaman is another example of how black is weaker than green when it comes to creatures. Compare it to Wyluli Wolf, which can be tapped to give another creature +1/+1 with no sacrifice at all! The ability to sacrifice another creature to give a creature +2/+2 is nice, but it's not enough to make up for the fact that you always have to sacrifice something when you use the Shaman, but you never have to sacrifice anything when you use the Wolf.</P>
