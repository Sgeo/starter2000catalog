<P>Femeref Archers can serve as a small creature on the ground, or it can "shoot down" an attacking creature with flying. This latter use is likely to be quite effective against blue, which has the most creatures with flying and which probably won't be able to get rid of your Archers after you play it. If your opponent doesn't have any flying creatures at the moment, you may need to weigh the risks and benefits of attacking with your Archers. The risk is that it could be killed in creature combat, leaving you vulnerable to opposing creatures with flying; the benefit is that it could help your attack deal more damage to your opponent. Which is the better choice depends on the situation: how much lower your opponent's life total is and whether you have other ways (such as Hurricane or Giant Spider) to deal with any flying creatures your opponent might play.</P>
