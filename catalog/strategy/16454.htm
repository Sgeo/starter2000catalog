<P>Fallow Earth is very similar to Stone Rain, except that Fallow Earth puts the land on top of your opponent's library instead of into his or her graveyard. Which is better depends on your goal. If you're trying to run your opponent out of lands completely, you don't want more of them drawn, so you'd prefer Stone Rain. But if you're simply trying to slow down your opponent's development and don't mind him or her replaying the lands you get rid of, you might prefer Fallow Earth. Remember that because the card your opponent draws is that land, it's not something else--like a spell card. So it comes down to a simple question: would you rather have your opponent draw spells or lands?</P>
