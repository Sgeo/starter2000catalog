<P>The trouble with Fog is that it stops a creature onslaught for only one turn. So if your opponent has a general creature advantage, it won't help you more than once. However, if your problem is a one-time situation--for instance, because your opponent played Giant Growth, Ray of Command, or the like--Fog can be an excellent way to handle the situation.</P>
