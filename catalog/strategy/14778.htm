<P>Like Jayemdae Tome, Jalum Tome lets you draw an extra card every turn. It has the advantage of a cheaper mana cost, but it also has the disadvantage that whenever you use it you have to discard a card as well as getting to draw one. This is normally worth it only if your deck has ways to use the discarded cards, such as ways to bring creatures back</P>
