<P>When you play Lightning Blast, make sure you take full advantage of the fact that it's an instant! For instance, you might attack with a big creature. If your opponent blocks with two small creatures, expecting that their combined power will kill your big one, you can play the instant to kill off one of the blockers, upsetting the plan. If your big creature then kills the other small creature and survives, you've used one card to get rid of two--an important win for you.</P>
