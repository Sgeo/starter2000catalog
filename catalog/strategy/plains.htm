<P>One powerful white deck is the white "swarm" deck, which uses about thirty one-mana and two-mana white creatures, plus four Crusades and some Armageddons, Disenchants, and possibly Tariffs. The deck tries to win a short game by overwhelming its opponent in the first few turns, but it also has some long-run chances; the Crusades can make its creatures extremely powerful and the Armageddon may allow it to "reset" the game to a situation where no one has any lands on the table.<BR>
White is also an excellent support color for many defensive decks, such as white-blue control, which uses white for destruction and blue for counterspelling and card drawing, or red-white control, which uses a combination of red damage and white spells for destruction and hopes to win the game by eventually playing a big "X" spell.</P>
