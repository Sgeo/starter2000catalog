<P>Serenity is a slow Wrath of God for artifacts and enchantments. Its slowness is a drawback, though--for the Serenity to be effective, it has to stay on the table until the start of your next upkeep. This gives your opponent one last chance to attack you with artifact creatures, leaves annoying enchantments around for one more turn, and--most importantly--gives your opponent a chance to stop the Serenity completely by playing Disenchant.</P>
