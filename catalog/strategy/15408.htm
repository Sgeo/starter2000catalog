<P>In Sealed-Deck play, a 2/3 artifact creature for four mana with the potential to gain flying is a good deal. It's a card you know you'll be able to play when you have four lands, no matter what color mana they produce. And creatures with flying are important in Sealed Deck, even if gaining the flying costs three mana every turn, as it does here.</P>
