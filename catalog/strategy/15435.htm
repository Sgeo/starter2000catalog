<P>You might play a Mystic Compass in Sealed Deck if you have a lot of creatures with landwalk. This will enable you to make your creatures unblockable no matter what colors your opponent is playing. Also, if you don't draw all your colors, you can use the Compass on your own lands, giving you access to the mana you need.</P>
