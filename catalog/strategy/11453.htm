<P>You usually won't want to attack with Pradesh Gypsies, as it's much better used for its ability. If you're using it on offense, you should do so after blockers are declared; effectively, you're forcing your opponent to commit to a blocking plan without knowing what the Gypsies is going to do, then deciding how to use it for maximum benefit. If you expect to need the Gypsies for defense, think about keeping <IMG SRC="../images/green_mana.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=12 ALT="" BORDER="0"> available; you have to decide whether the mana is better spent on your Gypsies' ability or on playing spells.</P>
