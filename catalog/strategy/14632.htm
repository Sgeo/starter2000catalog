<P>Volcanic Geyser, like Blaze, is an "X" spell: the more mana you pump into it, the more damage it deals. There's a trade-off between the two cards; Volcanic Geyser costs <IMG SRC="../images/red_mana.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=12 ALT="" BORDER="0"> more, but it's an instant, so it's usable in a greater variety of situations, such as creature combat situations. When choosing between the two, think about how you expect to use them. If you have creatures in your deck (especially if you have creatures with first strike), you might prefer Volcanic Geyser, so you can pull more surprises on your opponent during combat. You also might prefer the Geyser if you're concerned about counterspelling; the fact that it's an instant means there's a better chance you'll be able to play it when your opponent is tapped out. When neither of these considerations applies, you should save the mana and stick with Blaze.</P>
