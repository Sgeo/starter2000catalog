<P>Razortooth Rats isn't that strong a card, but it's still a good example of why a creature enchantment like Fear isn't worth it. The Rats is basically a 2/1 creature with Fear, and it costs you three mana and one card to get it on the table. By contrast, playing a 2/1 creature and putting Fear on it would cost you four mana and two cards.</P>
