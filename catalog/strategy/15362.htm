<P>Say your opponent attacks with a 4/4 creature. For defense, you have two 2/2 creatures and a Resistance Fighter. What you should do is block the 4/4 attacker with both your 2/2 creatures, then sacrifice the Resistance Fighter so that the 4/4 attacker deals no damage. You'll then effectively have traded your 1/1 Resistance Fighter for your opponent's 4/4 creature.<BR>
The Fighter can also be used on offense; for instance, suppose you have two small creatures with flying and need two "hits" on your opponent to win. Your opponent has one big creature with flying available to block, plus several ground creatures. Your best play is to attack with both your flying creatures, then sacrifice your Fighter after your opponent blocks to save the blocked flying creature. The following turn, you attack with both your flying creatures again, dealing enough damage to win the game.</P>
