<P>A creature whose power and toughness are each equal to the number of forests you control can exhibit some surprising behaviors. An upside is that if your opponent somehow steals it, it will probably die immediately. Along with this advantage comes a drawback: Armageddon will kill it. Also, it tends to push you to play your lands instead of holding them in your hand, which isn't always a good idea; lands in your hand create some problems for your opponent, who doesn't know what they are. On the whole, green probably has better big, expensive creatures to play with, both in the <I>Classic</I><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> set and in expert-level expansions.</P>
