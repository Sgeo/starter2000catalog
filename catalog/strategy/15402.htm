<P>If you were allowed to play an unlimited number of lands every turn, Storm Cauldron would give you unlimited mana. The only card that allowed that was Fastbond (last printed in the <I>Revised Edition</I><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> set), which has now been banned or restricted in every tournament format because of this problem.</P>
