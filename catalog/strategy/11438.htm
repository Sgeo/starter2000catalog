<P>A Pestilence in play can dominate the board. You use it to deal whatever amount of damage will kill as many of your opponent's creatures as possible while preserving your own. If your opponent has a Pestilence, do everything possible to get rid of it; it may even be worthwhile to kill off your own creatures if this will cause there to be no creatures in play at the end of a turn, thereby getting rid of Pestilence.<BR>
If you're building a deck with Pestilence, the best creatures to use are creatures with protection from black (found in many expansions). Creatures with regeneration, though not as good as those with protection from black, may also be usable, as may creatures with high toughness.</P>
