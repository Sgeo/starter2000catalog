<P>The strength of a "hoser" card depends on the environment it's in. That is, it depends on the popularity of the cards it hoses. For most of <B>Magic</B> history, Walls haven't seen much play, so Goblin Digging Team hasn't been that good. But when the popularity of Walls increased, Goblin Digging Team saw some play as well.</P>
