<P>The most obvious use of Flying Carpet is to give one of your attacking creatures flying so that your opponent can't block it. But you should always look around for unexpected uses! For instance, if someone plays Hurricane, you might use your Carpet on one of your <I>opponent's</I> creatures to cause it to gain flying and die. In a similar way, it can save one of your creatures from an Earthquake. You also might consider using it on defense; if your opponent has a big creature with flying, you might need to keep your Flying Carpet untapped so that you can use one of your ground creatures to block.</P>
