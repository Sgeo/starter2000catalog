<P>Goblin Recruiter was at its strongest when Mogg Fanatic (a <I>Tempest</I><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> card) was in the environment. You could play your Recruiter and put all four of your Fanatics on top of your library, and the Fanatics were very strong. Although it's not as good as it was back then, the Recruiter can still work in a Goblin deck. It lets you play more lands than normal, because once you have enough lands, you play the Recruiter, and after that you'll draw Goblins.</P>
