<P>The most notable thing about Hero's Resolve is that the enchanted creature gains 5 toughness. This makes it very difficult for a red deck to kill the creature, as it would just have to deal too much damage. Black isn't bothered by it much, however, as Terror doesn't care what the creature's toughness is.</P>
