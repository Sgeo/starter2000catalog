<P>Dread of Night is amazingly strong against white swarm decks. Often, most of the creatures in that deck type have 1 toughness, and a single Dread of Night will kill all of them! Furthermore, Dread of Night is an enchantment, so it sticks around, forcing the white deck to use up a Disenchant to get rid of it.</P>
