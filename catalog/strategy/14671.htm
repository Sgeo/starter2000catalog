<P>While not the strongest creature in green, Grizzly Bears is a good example of how green creatures tend to be better than creatures in other colors. In contrast, blue has Vodalian Soldiers (a 1/2 creature for two mana), red has Goblin Hero (a 2/2 creature for three mana), black has Scathe Zombies (also a 2/2 creature for three mana), and white has Regal Unicorn (a 2/3 creature for three mana, which isn't as good as a 2/2 for two mana.)</P>
