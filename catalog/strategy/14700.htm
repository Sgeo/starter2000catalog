<P>Although green has only one creature with flying in the <I>Classic</I><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> set--and that creature is 0/1 (Birds of Paradise)--Rajdan Spirit is one of the many ways the color can nonetheless handle opposing creatures with flying. The Spirit turns your opponent's flying creature into a ground creature, which presumably will allow one of your big ground creatures to block the creature with flying and kill it. You should wait until after your opponent attacks to play this ability; that way, you might manage to persuade your opponent not to attack with any creatures with flying at all, in which case the Spirit will be available as a blocker on the ground.</P>
