<P>Raging Goblin is an excellent attacking card in the early game. If you play one on the first turn, your opponent might not deal with it until turn four or so, and in the meantime it deals 3 or 4 damage. Even if your opponent uses a card to kill it on the next turn, it was a good card for you: you each used up a card, but you also dealt 1 damage to your opponent.</P>
