<P>Early Harvest has potential to be a piece of an "engine" deck. That is, suppose you have a deck that draws a bunch of cards, uses those cards to get mana, spends that mana and uses one of the cards it drew to draw still more cards, and so on. If you have four or more basic lands, playing Early Harvest would allow you to go up in available mana, so it could fit into the deck. This would be a tricky deck to build and play, however, as you can play only one land a turn, so Early Harvest won't give you much extra mana until very late in the game. The fact that that the Harvest untaps only basic lands is also a significant limitation.</P>
