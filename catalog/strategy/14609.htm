<P>Direct damage spells are extremely valuable because of their flexibility. You can use Shock to get rid of your opponent's creatures, or, if your opponent's life total is low enough, you can use it on your opponent directly. One trap to avoid is using the spell on your opponent when he or she has a high life total. For example, if your opponent has 14 life, it's probably a lot better to kill a creature that has the potential to deal 1 damage every turn than it is to reduce that life total to 12.</P>
