<P>If you're going to give your opponent an extra card every turn, you'd better have a really good use for the extra cards <I>you'll</I> be getting! Howling Mines can work in decks that have ways to stop your opponent from untapping; cards that do this can be found in some expansions. But in most situations, your opponent will use the extra cards just as effectively as you will, so Howling Mines aren't worth putting in your deck.</P>
