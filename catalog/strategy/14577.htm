<P>Like Raise Dead, Strands of Night gets creatures out of your graveyard. The similarity ends there. Strands of Night involves additional costs (2 life and a swamp), but you can use it to get multiple creatures out, and it puts those creatures directly into play. This suggests that you might want to use creatures with comes-into-play abilities, which makes Strands of Night an effective way to get access to abilities on creatures currently in your graveyard. Another use of Strands of Night would be to put it into a deck that has creatures with high mana costs and a way to get them into your graveyard; the Strands then gives you a way around paying for them.</P>
