<P>Sibilant Spirit is a reasonable alternative to Air Elemental as a control deck's "kill" card. The advantage of its slightly greater power and toughness is balanced by the drawback of its higher mana cost. The cards your opponent draws probably won't be much of a problem: by the time you're attacking, you should have control anyway, with backup Counterspells in your hand.</P>
