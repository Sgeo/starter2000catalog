<P>The nice thing about Mischievous Poltergeist is that it doesn't force you to keep your lands untapped! That is, if you have a Drudge Skeleton you don't want to lose, you need to keep black mana available, which may limit your other actions. By contrast, because the cost to regenerate the Poltergeist is 1 life, you can go ahead and spend all your mana, and you'll still be able to regenerate it.</P>
