<P>The trouble with Pentagram of the Ages is its enormously high mana cost. Spending four mana every turn to stop damage from one creature is just not that exciting. It's probably okay in Sealed-Deck play, where you tend to have a lot of spare mana late in the game and not much to do with it, but in Constructed play, you really ought to be able to find a better way to spend your leftover mana. A further weakness of the Pentagram is its lack of surprise value. Reverse Damage, for instance, could really catch your opponent by surprise and make a big difference in the game, but because the Pentagram sits on the table, your opponent can see it coming and plan for it.</P>
