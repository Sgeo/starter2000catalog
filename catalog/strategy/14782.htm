<hr>
<P>Millstone decks try to win by running your opponent out of cards instead of by getting his or her life total down to 0. Most of the deck will probably be defensive, as you'll need to stay alive for a long time in order to give the Millstone a chance to work. You'll probably play blue and white, with cards like Counterspell and Wrath of God, in order to drag out the game as long as possible.</P>
