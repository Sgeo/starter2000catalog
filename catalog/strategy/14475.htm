<P>For only two mana, a 2/2 creature with first strike that can block flying creatures is one of the best bargains in the game. If you're playing a primarily white creature deck, you almost certainly want to use several of them. You do need to be a bit careful about the fact that the Archer costs two white mana, though; a two-color deck may have trouble getting it out early in the game.</P>
