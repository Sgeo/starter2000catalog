<hr>
<P>In Sealed-Deck play, direct damage is so powerful that even "bad" direct damage cards like Tremor should be played! Tremor is weaker than almost any other direct damage spell you can think of, but it can still almost always kill at least one creature and often more. One big reason is that your opponent is likely to choose blockers so that your attacking creatures deal 1 damage less than what they would need to dispatch the blocker; a surprise Tremor after combat can then finish the blocker off.</P>
