<P>Moss Diamond is slower at providing mana than green creatures such as Llanowar Elves, so generally the creatures are preferable. The Diamond is probably hardier, though; your opponent can't kill it with a Shock or an Earthquake, so a deck that uses Armageddon and the mana creatures may include a few Diamonds as well.</P>
