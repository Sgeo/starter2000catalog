<P>Mass destruction cards work best against a deck that uses a huge amount of the card type in question. That is, if your opponent has just a few artifacts, you're better off playing Disenchants or Shatters to get rid of them, because these spells are instants with a smaller mana cost. But if your opponent has a lot of artifacts, Shatterstorm can be really helpful.</P>
