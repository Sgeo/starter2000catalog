<P>The ability to deal 1 damage every turn is nice, and it can turn the tide in a Sealed-Deck game by killing off all your opponent's 1-toughness creatures, then dealing 1 damage to your opponent every turn. In Constructed play, however, the Rod's mana cost is awfully high; you might look for a cheaper alternative, such as red spells, Prodigal Sorcerer, or Skull Catapult.</P>
