<P>Fatal Blow might be an alternative to Terror for getting rid of your opponent's creatures. If your opponent is also playing black, it's a superior alternative. The restriction that the opposing creature must have been damaged this turn is serious, however. It may mean that you're trading two cards for one, which is seldom a good deal.</P>
