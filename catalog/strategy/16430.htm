<P>Psychic Venom gives blue an alternative way to deal damage to its opponent. The Venom works regardless of whether your opponent taps the land for mana or you tap the land somehow. Both are useful; the former may leave your opponent reluctant to play spells, and the latter is a great way to win that doesn't depend on creatures if you have a repeatable way to tap your opponent's lands.</P>
