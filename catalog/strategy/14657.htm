<P>If you include Goblin Kings in your deck, make sure you have a lot of Goblins! You may also want to cut down on cards that involve sacrificing your creatures; while these are valuable in many situations, they aren't compatible with playing the King, as Goblins that you sacrifice aren't around to get the King's bonus. Goblin Warrens is an exception, of course, because it gives you three Goblins for every two you sacrifice.</P>
