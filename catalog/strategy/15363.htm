<P>The big advantage of Diminishing Returns is that you get a new hand of seven cards. The big drawback is that your opponent gets one as well. So, to use the card effectively you need to expect that you're going to be able to play out your hand more quickly than your opponent. This means the card probably fits best in a deck with a lot of extremely cheap spells and possibly also ways to generate extra mana beyond what you can get by playing a land every turn, such as Dark Rituals.</P>
