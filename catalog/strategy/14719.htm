<P>Birds of Paradise can be useful in several ways. First, it gives you access to every color of mana. Second, it speeds up your deck's mana production. That is, if you play Birds on turn one, you have three mana available on turn two instead of just two. Third, it's not a land, so if you play Armageddon, your Birds will survive. These advantages make Birds of Paradise one of the strongest cards in green; it has been used in many highly successful decks.</P>
