<P>Sacrifice abilities tend to be a lot stronger than they look at first. For instance, with a Fallen Angel you can:<BR>
&#149; Get rid of a creature your opponent is about to steal.<BR>
&#149; Sacrifice a creature your opponent has blocked and is about to kill anyway, in order to have the Angel deal 2 more damage.<BR>
&#149; Kill all your creatures if someone is playing Living Death (from the <I>Tempest</I><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> expansion).<BR>
&#149; Sacrifice a small creature in order to save the Angel, if it's about to take 3 damage.<BR>
A big strength of the ability is that it requires no tapping and no mana, which means you can play it any time; you don't have to keep resources available.</P>
