<P>Polymorph takes a creatures and "turns it into" another. There are two ways to use it. You can play it on one of your own small creatures and hope to get something big out of the deal, or you can play it on one of your opponent's big creatures and hope that he or she will get something small. In both cases, you may even be able to control the outcome, using Dream Cache or Painful Memories, for instance.</P>
