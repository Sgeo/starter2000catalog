<P>Usually you use Dream Cache to bury two worthless cards from your hand on the bottom of your library. If you have Dream Caches in your deck, you're more willing to play cards like Unsummon that are great against some opposing decks but may be useless against others. Dream Cache has another use, too. If you're playing Call of the Wild or another card that depends on what you have on top of your library, Dream Cache lets you influence this to your advantage.</P>
