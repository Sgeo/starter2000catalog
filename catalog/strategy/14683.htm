<P>Giant Growth is an example of "sideways creature kill." That is, it doesn't kill a creature directly, but in many blocking situations it can cause you to win a creature fight you would've lost otherwise. You can also use it to deal an extra 3 damage to your opponent, but you need to be cautious.</P>
