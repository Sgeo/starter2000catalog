<P>An Infantry Veteran on the table represents a threat that makes it much more difficult for your opponent to block your attackers. For instance, if you attack with two 1/1 creatures and your opponent has a 2/2 creature available for defense, he or she may be unwilling to block with it, as you'd then use the Veteran to pump whichever creature is blocked, allowing you to trade your 1/1 for your opponent's 2/2.</P>
