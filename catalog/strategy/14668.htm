<P>Llanowar Elves works in all sorts of green decks. Its greatest asset is its flexibility; effectively, you can use it as a creature or as a land. Its biggest drawback is that it's pretty easy for your opponent to kill it, so a deck with Elves will still want to have plenty of land cards, just in case.</P>
