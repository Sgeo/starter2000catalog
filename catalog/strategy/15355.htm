<P>If your deck needs a combination of artifacts and/or enchantments to function, Enlightened Tutor can be extremely useful, helping you to get whatever "piece" of your combo you're currently missing. When you use it, however, be aware that you're giving your opponent a card advantage; the card you search for goes on top of your library, not into your hand.</P>
