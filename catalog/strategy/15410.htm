<P>Teferi's Puzzle Box has the effect of rapidly "churning" both players' hands. Interestingly, when combined with Zur's Weirding, it has the effect of letting each player pay life to force the opponent to give up his or her hand every turn. Because the Puzzle Box creates a lot of draws, its strongest uses are in combination with cards that trigger off drawing cards. The Zur's Weirding combo is an example of this, but probably not the best one; you might want to look in <B>Magic</B> expansions to see what else you can find.</P>
