<P>One use of Havenwood Battleground might be in a deck that uses only a small number of green cards but they have <IMG SRC="../images/green_mana.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=12 ALT="" BORDER="0"><IMG SRC="../images/green_mana.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=12 ALT="" BORDER="0"> in their mana costs. If you don't use Battlegrounds, you'll need to play a large number of forests to be sure of being able to play your green cards, and if your deck has mostly nongreen cards, you won't want to do that. The Battlegrounds lessen this difficulty; with one of them, you can play one of your green spells once, even if you don't have any other lands that produce green mana.</P>
