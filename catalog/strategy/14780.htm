<hr>
<P>By allowing you to draw an extra card every turn, this card (known as "the Book") gives you an advantage that will win you the game if allowed to work over time. If you have a Jayemdae Tome, you want to stall as much as possible in order to give it time to work. If your opponent has one, you want to either get rid of it or force the game to a quick conclusion, because if the game lasts much longer, you're not likely to win.</P>
