<P>Untamed Wilds is a close cousin of Rampant Growth. They both put a land into play, accelerating your mana development and potentially giving you access to a new color of mana. The difference is that Untamed Wilds costs one mana more, but the new land comes in untapped, so you can use it right away. What does this mean? In many situations, it makes no difference at all--the one mana extra spent on the Untamed Wilds is recovered because the new land is untapped. Untamed Wilds is better if you need access to the new color <I>right away</I>; for instance, if you have ten forests and you want to play a Blaze this turn, you can play Untamed Wilds for a mountain, then play Blaze. Rampant Growth won't help you in that case. Rampant Growth is more useful in the early game, however. If you have only two lands, you can play Rampant Growth, but an Untamed Wilds would have to wait. The early game is so important that this consideration is usually the deciding factor, and you'll put Rampant Growth in your deck.</P>
