<P>Although green has great basic creatures, unblockability isn't its strong suit. Elven Riders is a 3/3 creature that acts kind of like a creature with flying on attack, and it costs five mana. In contrast, for five mana, blue gets a 4/4 creature with flying (Air Elemental) and black gets a 3/3 creature with flying that has a great ability (Fallen Angel). Red and white don't have directly comparable five-mana creatures with flying, though they have 2/2 and 4/4 flying creatures that have positive abilities at four and six mana, respectively, suggesting that for five mana they could get a 3/3 creature with flying that would have a positive ability--a card that would be better than Elven Riders.</P>
