<P>Creeping Mold is an excellent card for land destruction decks because of its flexibility. In this type of deck, its primary use is to destroy land, but if there's an artifact or enchantment you really need to get rid of, you can use it on that as well.<BR>
If you're not playing white, in a pinch Creeping Mold might serve as a substitute for Disenchants. The higher mana cost and less flexible timing (sorcery instead of instant) are major drawbacks. Unlike Disenchant, Creeping Mold does have the advantage that it will never be completely useless: if your opponent isn't playing artifacts or enchantments, you can use it on his or her lands.</P>
