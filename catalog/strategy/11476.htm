<P>First strike is an excellent ability in red because it combines so well with direct damage. For instance, if you attack with your Sabretooth Tiger and your opponent blocks with a 4/4 creature, a Shock will allow you to kill your opponent's creature without losing the Tiger. Notice that if the Tiger didn't have first strike, this tactic would be less effective--you'd still kill your opponent's creature, but you'd lose the Tiger as well.<BR>
That said, a Sabretooth Tiger is a little small for the amount of mana you're paying for it, so it's probably not worth putting in your deck. But if you see a red creature with first strike that has better stats compared with its mana cost, it's likely to work quite nicely in a deck that also uses direct damage.</P>
