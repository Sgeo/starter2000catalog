<P>Forcing your opponent to discard cards is one of black's strong suits. Rag Man isn't the most efficient way black can accomplish this, however; Abyssal Specter is a far superior alternative. While the Specter does have to deal damage to your opponent in order to force a discard, its flying ability and the lack of a cost on the discard more than make up for this. Furthermore, if your opponent has only noncreature cards in hand, Rag Man has no effect, but the Specter still forces a discard.</P>
