<P>"Firebreathing" is an ability that doesn't work very well on a Wall. The trouble is that it's an <I>active</I> ability--you have to pump mana into it to get it to work every turn--and Walls are <I>passive.</I> Your defense is generally only as strong as its weakest link, which in this case would be the turn you don't have any leftover mana to spend on the Wall's ability, leaving it just a 0/5. For this reason, you'd much rather have a Wall with some inherent power, such as Wall of Air, which is 1/5 and has flying to boot.</P>
