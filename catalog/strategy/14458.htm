<P>Because of red's direct damage potential, Circle of Protection: Red is the strongest of the Circles of Protection. As with all of them, be careful about spending your mana once you get this out! Maybe the spell you want to play is really not so urgent and your mana would be better saved to power the Circle.</P>
