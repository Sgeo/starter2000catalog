<P>Call of the Wild works best if you somehow know what the top card of your library is. You might play a Dream Cache, for instance, and put a big creature from your hand on top of your library. You can then use Call of the Wild to put that creature into play! If you use cards from <B>Magic</B> expansions, you can probably do this without ever leaving green--that is, many expansions contain green cards that let you change or look at your library's top card.</P>
