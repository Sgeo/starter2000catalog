<P>Juxtapose is most often used to "give" your opponent a permanent you don't want; look in expansion sets for the best of these. It can also be useful to trade an artifact that works equally well no matter who controls it, such as Meekstone or Howling Mine, for an artifact you want to control, like a "mana Diamond" or an artifact creature.</P>
