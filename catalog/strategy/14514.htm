<P>Like Boomerang, Unsummon gets rid of cards already in play. Unsummon has less flexibility but also a lower mana cost. It's sometimes used in offensive decks; it gets rid of a creature until your opponent can play it again. This is especially good if the opposing creature has some kind of "comes into play" cost, such as Hidden Horror does.</P>
