<P>Fire Elemental is a "big ground pounder." That is, it has pretty good power and toughness but no special abilities. It combines well with cards that deal damage to every creature, such as Earthquake: if you play Earthquake for 3 damage, a lot of creatures will die (hopefully including your opponent's creatures), but Fire Elemental will survive and be able to attack.</P>
