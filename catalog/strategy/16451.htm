<P>A Fyndhorn Brownie lets you use your Prodigal Sorcerer or your Samite Healer twice. It also lets you attack with a creature, then untap it so it's available as a blocker. If you're using the Brownie in this latter role, you might want to wait until your opponent's attack before you decide which creature to untap. That way, if you attacked with several creatures, you can untap whichever will be the most useful as a blocker. You'll also have the option of spending your mana on something else should the situation make that more desirable.</P>
