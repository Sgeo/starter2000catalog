<P>The big attraction of an Ornithopter is its 0 mana cost. If your deck needs to have a lot of artifacts or creatures in play (so it can sacrifice them, for instance), Ornithopters may be an ideal choice. Furthermore, in the earliest part of the game Ornithopter is a reasonable blocker. It's especially nice if your zero-mana 0/2 creature with flying blocks your opponent's two-mana 1/1 creature with flying, leaving it unable to deal damage to you turn after turn. An Ornithopter isn't worth playing for the blocking alone, but if you also have another use for it, the combination can easily make it worthwhile.</P>
