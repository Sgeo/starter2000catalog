<P>The best use of Ruins of Trokair is to play Armageddon. Because your lands are all going to be destroyed anyway, there's no harm in sacrificing one of them, and the Ruins let you play Armageddon when you have only three lands on the table instead of waiting until you have four. Against this advantage, you have the drawback that the Ruins comes into play tapped, which means you can't get any mana out of it on the turn you play it. Depending on how much your deck relies on speed, this may or may not be worth it. A very fast deck is better off just using plains.</P>
