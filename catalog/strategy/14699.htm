<P>Fyndhorn Elder is a specialty card for green decks that use an enormous amount of mana. You already have three mana when you play it, so it puts you at a total of at least five mana, which is more than many decks need to have. Still, the Elder might be worth playing if your deck depends on big spells.</P>
