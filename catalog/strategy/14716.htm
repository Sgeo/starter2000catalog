<P>Elvish Archers is pretty strong if you expect to be up against a green or white deck. Its 2 power and first strike ability are a reasonable return on the two mana and one card you have to spend to put it on the table. It's weaker against red because it's easily killed by direct damage, and against blue you'd much prefer a River Boa, which is probably a slightly better creature overall, because it has both islandwalk and regeneration.</P>
