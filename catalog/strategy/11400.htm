<P>Merfolk of the Pearl Trident is a perfect example of the fact that, when it comes to creatures without flying, blue is the weakest color in the game. For one mana, each of the other colors gets a better creature: green gets Llanowar Elves, a 1/1 creature that can tap for mana; red gets Raging Goblin, a 1/1 creature that can attack the turn it comes under your control; white gets Tundra Wolves, a 1/1 creature with first strike; and black (the second weakest creature color) gets Bog Rats, a 1/1 creature that can't be blocked by Walls. Of course, blue has other strengths, such as counterspelling, that make up for this weakness.<BR>
That said, Merfolk of the Pearl Trident is still playable with Lord of Atlantis in a Merfolk deck, which will probably also use several other cheap Merfolk, plus counterspells.</P>
