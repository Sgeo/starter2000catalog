<P>Just as Ardent Militia is a larger version of Standing Troops, Staunch Defenders is a larger version of Venerable Monk. This time, you get quite a bit more for your extra mana, though: the creature gains 1 power and 2 toughness, and you gain 2 extra life when it comes into play. In contrast, in the Ardent Militia-Standing Troops example, your two mana just nets you +1/+1 on your creature. The upshot is that in this case, putting the more expensive card into your deck may well be worthwhile, while in the other case, it probably isn't.</P>
