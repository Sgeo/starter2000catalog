<P>Ethereal Champion is sort of a Kjeldoran Royal Guard in reverse. The Guard can take damage that was intended for you; you can take damage that was intended for the Champion. Both abilities are useful. In this case, it can keep your Champion alive to deal damage to your opponent turn after turn.</P>
