<P>One type of green-white deck is the so called "MaroGeddon" deck. It contains several large green creatures plus Armageddon, which it hopes to play once it has a creature out. It may also use creature mana (such as Birds of Paradise and Llanowar Elves) so that its mana base isn't completely destroyed by the Armageddon.</P>
