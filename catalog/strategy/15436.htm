<P>If you have a creature that's about to get killed anyway, using Phyrexian Vault is a great deal--you get an extra card! It's also good if your deck generates a lot of 0/1 token creatures or has other creatures that you don't mind sacrificing. If you don't expect either of these situations to occur often, you're better off using a Jayemdae Tome for your card drawing. The mana cost is higher, but not having to sacrifice your creatures will be worth it.</P>
