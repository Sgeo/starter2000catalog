<P>The drawback of Goblin Elite Infantry isn't as bad as it looks. Often your opponent won't have anything to block it with. Also, 2/1 creatures are pretty common in many decks, and against a 2/1 creature, it doesn't matter if your creature is 1/1 or 2/2; the two creatures will kill each other either way.</P>
