<P>Crimson Hellkite's mana cost is enormous. Against this, you have the advantage that once you get it in play, it's likely to win the game for you by itself by first killing all your opponent's creatures, then heading for your opponent. Because of this, if you have a Hellkite in hand, you should make every effort to prolong the game, even making disadvantageous trades if necessary to drag things out until you can finally play it.</P>
