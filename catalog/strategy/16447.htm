<P>Vertigo is a weak card because it's narrow. Compare it with Shock, for example: it does more when played on a creature with flying, but against ground creatures or players it's useless, while Shock can still deal 2 damage. You'd rather play with a card that can do something pretty good in many situations than a card that can do a little bit more but in a lot fewer situations.</P>
