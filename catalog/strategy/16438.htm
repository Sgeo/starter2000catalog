<P>Many of your opponent's spells can work to your advantage if you can change their targets. For instance, you can have your opponent's Disenchant target one of his or her artifacts instead of one of yours, or you can make your opponent's Shock target one of his or her own creatures. The tricky part about Deflection is that it takes four mana to play; that's a lot of mana to keep hanging around in hopes that your opponent will play a spell you can play Deflect on profitably.</P>
