<P>Howl from Beyond should generally be played after blockers are declared. It has two uses. One is to kill one of your opponent's creatures that your opponent expected would live. Perhaps the better use, however, is to deal a lot of damage to your opponent. For instance, late in the game, if your opponent is at 10 life and has one big creature and you have two 1/1 creatures and ten lands, you attack with both your creatures, then play the Howl to give +9/+0 to whichever one your opponent doesn't block, winning the game.</P>
