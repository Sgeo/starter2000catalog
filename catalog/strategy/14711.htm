<P>Depending on how many lands are in your deck, Rowen lets you draw an extra card every two or three turns on the average. You might be able to improve this by using spells such as Dream Cache to control what card is on top of your library. Rowen does have a disadvantage, though: you have to show your opponent the first card you draw every turn, and that information can be helpful to your opponent.</P>
