<hr>
<P>In thinking about how strong an auctioned card is, you should think of putting a creature on the auction block as being roughly equivalent to killing it, because once it's up for auction, you and your opponent are competing for it on equal terms.<BR>
Once a creature is up for auction, the question is how high to bid. There are a lot of factors to consider here, including your life total, your opponent's life total, what spells you have in hand, and what spells your opponent is likely to have in hand. Depending on these factors, the bids might be very high or very low. For instance, if your opponent is at 3 life and you have a Shock in hand, you'd let your opponent win the bidding at 1 life, because you'd then play the Shock and expect to win. In the same situation, if your opponent were playing blue, you might expect your Shock to be countered, so you might go ahead and bid 2 life, expecting to win by attacking with the creature, because blue has a hard time handling permanents on the table. One other factor in the auction is that you want to be the first to make the bid that's likely to win. That is, if you think you and your opponent would each pay 5 life for the creature and neither would pay 6, you should jump the bidding up to 5 life so you get the creature rather than bidding a smaller amount and giving your opponent the chance to bid 5 life first.</P>
