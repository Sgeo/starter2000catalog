<hr>
<P>Is the Zombie's ability an advantage or a drawback? It's nice to know that if your creature is killed, you get it back the following turn. But what if the top card of your library was a card you really needed? Sure, you'll get it the following turn, but that may be too late. On the whole, the ability probably is an advantage: by the time you have four mana, you'd usually rather draw a 3/2 creature than a random card. This may not be true in every situation, however, so it does give you something to think about. You can also use this against your opponent. For instance, if you're in a position to win unless your opponent draws a specific card, you may be able to seal your win by killing your opponent's Gravebane Zombie, thereby determining what card he or she will draw next.</P>
