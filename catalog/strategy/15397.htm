<P>The two drawbacks on this card are nasty: you lose half your life, and you lose if you can't win in five turns. At least they do tend to do similar things: if you've paid half your life, you're not likely to win if the game goes a long time, anyway. And getting to choose your next five draws is an amazing advantage. Although Doomsday hasn't been used effectively in Constructed play so far, it wouldn't come as much of a surprise if someone found a way to do it.</P>
