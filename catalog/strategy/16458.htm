<P>Swampwalk is somewhat effective against black. The reason it's only somewhat effective, not dramatically effective, is that black is good at killing creatures, including creatures with swampwalk. Thus a creature with swampwalk won't get to hit and deal damage to a black mage as often as a creature with forestwalk or islandwalk will deal damage to a green or blue mage, respectively.</P>
