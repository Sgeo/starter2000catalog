<P>Tranquil Grove is repeatable mass-destruction for enchantments. Once you have a Grove in play, your opponent will be hard-pressed to make any positive use of enchantments at all! Its drawback compared with Tranquility is that you have to pay five mana the first time you want to destroy all enchantments--two to put the Grove on the table, and three to use it. If you have only three lands on the table, this could be a major problem; you might play the Grove one turn, expecting to use it the following turn, only to have your opponent Disenchant it in the meantime. Despite this drawback, a Grove can be devastating for a deck that makes heavy use of enchantments.</P>
