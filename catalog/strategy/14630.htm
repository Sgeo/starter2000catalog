<P>The fact that Boil is an instant makes it an excellent card against a blue-heavy deck. You don't want your opponent to counter your Boil, so you should try to play it when he or she is tapped out. This is where the instant comes in. If your opponent taps out at the end of your turn, expecting to untap immediately, you can create a nasty surprise by playing Boil right then.</P>
