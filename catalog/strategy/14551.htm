<P>Because it makes all your Merfolk better, Lord of Atlantis is a key card in a Merfolk deck. Such a deck typically uses four Lords of Atlantis, sixteen to twenty-four assorted Merfolk, several counterspells, and a few miscellaneous cards. It wants to win a short game, but the counterspells also give it some long-game potential.</P>
