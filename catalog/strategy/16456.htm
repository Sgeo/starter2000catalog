<hr>
<P>Late in a green-on-green game, an Unseen Walker can let you win in a hurry. It also has the advantage that once it gives a creature forestwalk, there's no risk in attacking your green opponent with that creature. That is, unlike with abilities granted by creature enchantments such as Lure, you don't need to be concerned about your opponent somehow getting rid of the extra ability and making you wish you hadn't attacked.</P>
