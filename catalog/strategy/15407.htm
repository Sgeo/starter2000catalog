<P>Is it a Golem made of lead, or is it a Golem destined to lead? Probably the former, as it's really better as a blocker than an attacker, as attacking leaves it unable to do anything the following turn. In any case, as with most artifact creatures, you're happy to put it in your sealed deck because it lessens your problems if you draw only some of your colors.</P>
