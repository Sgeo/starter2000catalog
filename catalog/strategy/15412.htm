<P>In practice, the value of Dragon Engine's ability is severely limited by its mana cost. Even if you do have ten lands in play, you probably won't want to tap them all to pump up the Engine. For this reason, there are probably better creatures for you to put in your Constructed deck. Sealed-Deck play is another story. In this environment, artifact creatures are extremely valuable because you can play them no matter what colors of mana the lands you draw can produce. For this reason, you'd include a Dragon Engine if you were lucky enough to find one in your deck.</P>
