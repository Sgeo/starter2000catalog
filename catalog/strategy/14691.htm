<P>Familiar Ground is at its best when you have a few big creatures and your opponent has a lot of small ones. That way, your opponent's small creatures won't be able to gang up on your big ones and kill them. That said, playing the card is probably not worth it. You can also influence creature combat with a number of other cards, most notably Giant Growth, and these are likely to be better for you overall.</P>
