<P>Divine Transformation can transform a small creature into something big and scary. Imagine your opponent's dismay when your 1/4 Standing Troops suddenly becomes 4/7! Be careful about giving up two cards for one, though; you don't want to play the Transformation only to have your opponent respond with a direct damage spell, killing the creature you were going to give the bonus to. This would effectively allow your opponent to use one card to get rid of two of your cards, a bad trade for you.</P>
