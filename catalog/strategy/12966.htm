<P>"Green five-color" decks use green as a base to access all the other colors. Rampant Growth is one way to do this; Birds of Paradise is another. Which you prefer depends on what your opponent is doing. If you're playing against Armageddon, you'd rather have Birds of Paradise; if you're playing against Hurricane or Wrath of God, you'd prefer Rampant Growth. As you become a more advanced player, you'll start to tune your decks to the environment--that is, the other decks you're likely to run into. Some environments may use Armageddon a lot, in which case Rampant Growth is a bad idea, but others may use it very little. Over time, you'll become more aware of what others are doing, and this will affect your own choices.</P>
