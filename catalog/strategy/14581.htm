<P>If your opponent is playing green and you have Perish, great! Think about timing it for maximum effect. Ideally, you'll create some kind of stalemate, then--when your opponent has three or four green creatures out--play Perish and attack with your swarms. In some situations, you may have to play Perish to kill only one or two creatures, but look for alternatives before doing this.<BR>
Playing <I>against</I> Perish also involves interesting strategic decisions. You don't want to get a lot of creatures killed at once, so in general you want to limit the number of green creatures you have in play. There will be exceptions, though; for instance, you may decide that if your opponent has a Perish, you'll lose no matter what you do, so you might as well play as if he or she doesn't have one and put out all your creatures. Or you may put out an extra small green creature in an attempt to get your opponent to play Perish, so you can then put out your really big creature and use it to win. Every situation is different, and there's a lot of guesswork; you need to think and plan accordingly.</P>
