<P>Because neither side has much ability to kill creatures, green-versus-green games have a potential for stalemates. In this type of situation, it's possible that both players will have large creatures sitting around, unable to attack, and a small creature with forestwalk will win the game for you. Shanodin Dryads can also be useful in the early game, because it costs only one mana; at that time, your opponent may not have any blockers at all.</P>
