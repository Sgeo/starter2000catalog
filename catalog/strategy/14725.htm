<P>The best use of Dwarven Ruins is to play Jokulhaups. All your lands will be destroyed anyway, and the Ruins lets you play Jokulhaups with five mana instead of with six. Another use for the Ruins would be in a deck that has two-mana instants; if you keep the Ruins untapped, your opponent has to deal with the possibility that you might play such a spell, even if the Ruins is your only land.</P>
