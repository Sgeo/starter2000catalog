<P>Panther Warriors and Redwood Treefolk present you with contrasting choices. Panther Warriors has 6 power and 3 toughness; the Treefolk is the other way around. Which is better? As with many things in the game, it depends. Panther Warriors will be best against a deck that doesn't have a lot of ways to deal damage and that relies on spells such as Pacifism, Terror, and Wrath of God to handle creatures. None of these spells is affected by what a creature's toughness is, so you might as well have a creature with a high power. For circumstances where you might prefer Redwood Treefolk, see its entry.</P>
