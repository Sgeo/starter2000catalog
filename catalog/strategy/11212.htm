<P>Conquer is an extension of red's ability to destroy land; it's more expensive than a normal land destruction spell, but you get to use the land instead of just destroying it. Its drawbacks are its higher mana cost and the fact that the Conquer could be hit with a Disenchant, returning the land to your opponent.</P>
