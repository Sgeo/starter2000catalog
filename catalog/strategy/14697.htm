<P>Lure is one way to break a creature stalemate. That is, if you and your opponent both have a bunch of creatures and neither is in a position to attack, you can play Lure on one of your small creatures, then attack with everything. All your opponent's creatures must block the creature with Lure on it, which will allow the rest of your creatures to get through unblocked, hopefully winning the game. This ploy does carry a risk, however. If your opponent can somehow kill the enchanted creature, his or her creatures can block as he or she wishes, which will probably be painful for you. So you need to weigh the situation carefully before deciding to do this. Maybe there's a way to get your opponent to use up creature-killing spells by doing something else that looks important but isn't.</P>
