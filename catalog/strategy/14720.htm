<P>Suppose you attack with a creature, your opponent doesn't block, and you have a Wyluli Wolf on the table. Should you use the Wolf so your creature deals an extra 1 damage? It might seem obvious that you should, but in fact that isn't always the case. For instance, if your opponent is playing with direct damage cards, he or she might be waiting for you to tap the Wolf so he or she can use direct damage to kill one of your creatures. Also, the Wolf might be important to your defenses during your opponent's next turn. However, if your opponent has no creatures on the table and kills creatures with spells that don't deal damage (like Terror or Wrath of God), you want to use the Wolf to deal an extra 1 damage.</P>
