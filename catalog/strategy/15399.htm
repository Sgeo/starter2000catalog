<P>Most land destruction spells cost at least three mana. Blight is a trade-off; it has the advantage of costing only two mana but the drawback that your opponent gets to use the enchanted land one last time. Also, Blight can be removed with Disenchant or otherwise destroyed, allowing your opponent to save the enchanted land. These drawbacks probably aren't worth the savings, though if you're not able to use a regular land destruction spell (because you're playing Sealed Deck, for instance, and your opponent has a really nasty land, or you're playing a mono-black deck that doesn't use cards from expansion sets), a Blight may be worthwhile.</P>
