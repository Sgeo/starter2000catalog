<P>Stupor is a weakened version of Hymn to Tourach, a <I>Fallen Empires</I><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> card that forces your opponent to discard two cards at random for only two mana. And even though it's weakened, Stupor is still worthwhile; it shrinks your opponent's hand and gives you card advantage at the same time.</P>
