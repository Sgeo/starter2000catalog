<P>Library of Lat-Nam presents your opponent with a Hobson's choice: would he or she rather have you draw three cards at random or the one card you really need? Its biggest weakness is that it's a five-mana sorcery; because of its counterspelling, blue would greatly prefer to keep its lands untapped until the end of its opponent's turn.</P>
