<P>It can be really annoying to your opponent to play a large Blaze, expecting to win the game, only to have you play Reverse Damage. The tricky part of playing Reverse Damage is having the three mana available to pay for it. That's a lot to keep untapped, and if you want to have the ability to play Counterspell as well, you may need to have <I>four</I> lands available: two islands and two plains.</P>
