<P>Browse is sort of like Jayemdae Tome, except that not only does it give you extra cards, it also lets you quickly search for the cards you need. A Browse can easily give you six or seven good cards before you have to stop using it lest you run yourself out of cards; this should be enough to win the game.</P>
