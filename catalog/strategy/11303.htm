<hr>
<P>If your opponent is relying on damage to kill creatures, Giant Strength can be worthwhile, as it makes that more difficult. If possible, you should play it when your opponent is tapped out so that he or she can't play a damage spell in response, causing you to lose two cards for one. If that's not possible, another ploy is to attack with your creatures, assuming that if your opponent has a damage spell, it will come out at this point. Then you play Giant Strength; it takes a very good opponent to take damage from a creature he or she could kill in case you're going to play something after combat.</P>
