<P>If you're playing Armageddon in your deck, you might consider playing Marble Diamonds as well; they'll survive the Armageddon, so you'll have at least a little bit of mana afterward. Look out for their slowness, however--if your deck depends heavily on playing a lot of spells in the first two turns, such as a Crusade deck does, you won't want to include the Diamonds.</P>
