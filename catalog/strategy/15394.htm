<P>Nightmare should be put in only a mono-black deck, where it's very strong. If you play it when you have six lands in a mono-black deck that uses only swamps, for instance, the Nightmare will be a 6/6 creature with flying--a great creature for six mana. But if your deck is half black and half another color, so only half the lands are swamps, on average the Nightmare will be a 3/3 creature with flying--not that good for six mana.<BR>
Also, if you're using Nightmare in your deck, you'll want to think twice before including any nonbasic lands, as they won't help strengthen your Nightmare. It's possible that the lands will still be worthwhile, but you do need to remember this disadvantage when considering whether to put them into your deck.</P>
