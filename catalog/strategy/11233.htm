<P>Derelor is excellent against decks that rely on direct damage spells for creature control. Its 4 toughness means it's difficult for these decks to kill it, and if they don't, it deals 4 damage a turn! If your opponent does kill your Derelor, its drawback doesn't matter; if he or she doesn't kill it, you're happy to have it deal its damage.</P>
