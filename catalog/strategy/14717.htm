<P>Elder Druid has the advantage of flexibility. You can use it as a 2/2 creature, or you can use it to keep tapping some permanent of your opponent's. It does have a big drawback though: the mana cost of the latter ability is enormous! You'll probably use it only late in the game, when you have a lot of mana you don't know what to do with. Before then, you just won't be able to afford the ability, as you'll need your mana to pay for your spells.</P>
