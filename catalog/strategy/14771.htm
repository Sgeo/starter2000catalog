<P>Ankh of Mishra can be useful as another way for a very fast deck to deal damage, and 2 damage for every land can add up very quickly. Creatures are likely to deal damage faster, but if your opponent is playing a defensive deck, his or her destruction spells are likely to concentrate on creatures, so the Ankh may have greater durability.</P>
