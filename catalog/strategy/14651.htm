<hr>
<P>Direct damage decks often use Earthquake for mass creature control. By using one card to get rid of a lot of creatures, you allow yourself to use your other cards on your opponent. Another use for Earthquake is in a deck with a lot of flying creatures. There the idea is that your creatures will survive the Earthquake, while your opponent's creatures--which you hope won't have flying--won't survive.</P>
