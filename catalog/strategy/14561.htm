<P>Coercion lets you look at your opponent's hand and get rid of one card of your choice. When you play it, think for a bit before what you decide to take. The obvious choice isn't always the best one; for instance, you might do best to take the land needed to play a crucial spell instead of taking the spell itself.</P>
