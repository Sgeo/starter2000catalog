<P>Grinning Totem takes a card out of your opponent's deck and gives you a chance to use it. This works best when your opponent has a key card he or she has to play to win; for instance, your opponent's deck might consist of fifty-nine lands and defensive cards, plus a single Blaze. If you get rid of the Blaze, your opponent can't beat you, except by running you out of cards, which he or she may or may not be able to do.</P>
