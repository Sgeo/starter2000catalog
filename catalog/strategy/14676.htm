<P>In Sealed Deck, a Giant Spider is an excellent way to shut down your opponent's air game, as it can block and kill small creatures with flying and it can also block medium-sized creatures with flying and survive. Furthermore, its high toughness makes it hard to kill with direct damage or similar means.</P>
