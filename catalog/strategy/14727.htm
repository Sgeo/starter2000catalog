<P>White-blue control decks use Counterspell and similar cards, Wrath of God and other creature-killing spells, Disenchant, some card drawing, and possibly a way to gain life. They include about two "kill cards"--cards that enable the deck to win the game. The idea is to play a slow game, parrying whatever threats your opponent makes against you and gaining extra cards from your card drawing. Eventually you put out one of your kill cards, using Counterspells to protect it, and win.</P>
