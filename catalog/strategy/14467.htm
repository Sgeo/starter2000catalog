<P>Often the threat of saving 1 damage is stronger than actually doing it. If your opponent deals damage to you while you have a Samite Healer on the table, you need to think about whether to use the Healer to prevent 1 damage or to keep it to possibly save a creature later. You'll probably want to be consistent, though: if your opponent is dealing damage to you every turn with a creature, either use the Healer every time or keep it untapped every time. There's no point in keeping it untapped one turn, preventing your opponent from using damage to kill your creatures, then tapping it the following turn, allowing your opponent to kill creatures with damage cards. The reverse is equally true: if you tap your Healer one turn and your opponent uses the opportunity to kill some of your other creatures, you might as well keep tapping it in succeeding turns, as your opponent's damage cards are now used up.</P>
