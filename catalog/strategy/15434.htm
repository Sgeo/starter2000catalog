<P>Timing is important in how you use Waiting in the Weeds. If your opponent is playing green, you want to wait until all his or her forests are tapped. If not, you need to think carefully about exactly when to play it. If you play it too soon, you won't get enough Squirrels to make it worthwhile; if you play it too late, your opponent may have a Counterspell or an Earthquake, either of which effectively cancels your card out.</P>
