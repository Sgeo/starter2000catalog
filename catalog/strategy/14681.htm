<P>Redwood Treefolk and Panther Warriors present you with contrasting choices. Redwood Treefolk has 3 power and 6 toughness; Panther Warriors is the other way around. The choice between the two is interesting. If your opponent's deck dishes out a lot of damage, you want the Treefolk, because it can get into creature combat with, for example, a 3/1 creature and live through it, and it can survive most direct damage spells. Against other deck types, you may prefer Panther Warriors. (See its entry for more details.)</P>
