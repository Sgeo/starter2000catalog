<P>If you're able to make a 1/1 creature with flying every turn, you're likely to win the game. The Hive's big drawback, however, is its enormous mana cost. It costs you ten mana to make the first creature, and five more for each creature after that! If you're looking for a late-game advantage for your Constructed deck, you're likely to do better finding a different way to gain that advantage, such as a Jayemdae Tome.</P>
