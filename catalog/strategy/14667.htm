<hr>
<P>Under ideal circumstances, Vitalize could be a great surprise card. If a bunch of your creatures are tapped, your opponent may attack with a lot of creatures, expecting you to be unable to block. Play this, and--surprise!--all your creatures are now untapped, allowing you to block and kill several attackers. That's the dream, anyway. In practice, it can be difficult to attain, because if your opponent has a lot of creatures, you probably won't be able to attack with a lot of your creatures, or they'll be blocked and killed. The upshot is that if your opponent has a lot of creatures, most of yours will probably be untapped in the first place.</P>
