<P>Terror exemplifies black's strength in killing creatures. Its low mana cost and instant status are both major advantages. The best time for a Terror is when your opponent is doing something to strengthen the creature, such as playing a Giant Growth on it, so that your Terror gives you two cards for one. But even on a plain creature, using a single card and two mana to get rid of it is often a good deal.</P>
