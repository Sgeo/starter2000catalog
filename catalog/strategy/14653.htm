<P>Jokulhaups has two major uses. One is as a "reset button"--effectively, if you're losing, it allows you to start the game over, except that life totals remain the same. The other is in a deck that wins with enchantments; these survive the Jokulhaups, and hopefully your enchantments will enable you to win before your opponent can recover. In either case, when you're about to play Jokulhaups, you might want to save up cards in your hand for a few turns so you'll have things to do afterward.</P>
