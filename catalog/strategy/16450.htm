<P>Like Shanodin Dryads, Cat Warriors has the potential to win a green-versus-green game for you if the game would otherwise be stuck in a stalemate. The Warriors advantage is that once you get it out, it deals damage twice as fast. Against this, you have the drawback that it doesn't come out on the first turn. While neither creature is great if your opponent isn't playing green, in that situation you'd clearly prefer the Dryads, which would still have some early-game potential.</P>
