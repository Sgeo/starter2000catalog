<P>Hammer of Bogardan is one answer a red deck has against a slow control deck. If your opponent uses counterspells on your Hammer, you can keep getting it back and playing it again; eventually, he or she will run out of counterspells. If your opponent is playing a fast deck, however, the Hammer isn't so good; you're better off with a Shock or a Lightning Blast, which both deal more damage for the amount of mana they cost and are instants to boot.</P>
