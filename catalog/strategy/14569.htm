<P>Regeneration is primarily a defensive ability. It lets you block a large attacker turn after turn without taking any damage. The trickiest problem with regeneration is that you need to have mana available in order to use it. You'll find that you're constantly forced to choose between playing spells you want to play and keeping mana available for regeneration. When you make this choice, think about the situation. If your opponent has a 10/10 creature on the table that your Skeletons can block effectively, regeneration is very important; you might even want to save mana so you can regenerate more than once in case your opponent uses direct damage on the Skeletons after combat. On the other hand, if all your opponent's creatures have flying or if you have other good blockers on the ground, regeneration may not be so important. The best choice could be to go ahead and play your other spells; if your opponent uses a card to kill the Skeletons, it's not that big a deal.</P>
