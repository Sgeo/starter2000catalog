<P>Warrior's Honor is best used after your opponent has made blocking decisions. For instance, if he or she blocks a 2/3 creature with a 3/3 creature and blocks a 1/4 creature with a 4/2 creature, Warrior's Honor will make your attackers 3/4 and 2/5, which means your creatures will win both fights, instead of the other way around!</P>
