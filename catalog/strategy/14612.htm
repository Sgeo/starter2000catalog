<P>Spitting Earth is much less flexible than most other direct damage spells, because it deals damage only to creatures. If your opponent is at 1 life, a Shock will win the game for you but a Spitting Earth won't. For this reason, if you're looking for direct damage cards for your deck, you probably have better choices.</P>
