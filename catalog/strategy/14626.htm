<P>As a general rule, you should attack <I>before</I> you play spells, including creature spells. This is even more true with Flame Spirit because of its "firebreathing" ability; even if you don't plan to spend any mana to pump up your Spirit, your opponent doesn't know this and may make a decision he or she wouldn't otherwise make because of the threat. If that happens, it will normally work to your advantage.</P>
