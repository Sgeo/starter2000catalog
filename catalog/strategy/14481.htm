<P>Light of Day shuts down black creatures quite effectively. The tradeoffs between it and Circle of Protection: Black are interesting. The advantages of the Circle are that it costs less and that it can stop damage from spells as well as creatures. But Light of Day has advantages, too: once it's on the table, you don't have to pay mana to use it, and it makes black creatures useless for both attack and defense. If you have a Circle out, your opponent's creatures can still block effectively.</P>
