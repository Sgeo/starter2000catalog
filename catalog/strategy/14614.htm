<P>Generally you'll prefer to use flexible cards over inflexible ones, so your deck will probably have Disenchants or Pillages instead of Shatters. If you're not playing white, though, and you really need early-game artifact destruction, or if you need an instant card that can destroy artifacts, Shatter may serve your purpose.</P>
