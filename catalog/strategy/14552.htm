<P>Keeping two blue mana available so you're in a position to play a Counterspell can be a pain. Daring Apprentice gives you one way around this: if it's on the table and has been under your control since the beginning of the turn, you have spell countering capability, regardless of whether you have mana available. A further advantage to using the Apprentice to counter a spell is that your countering isn't itself vulnerable to your opponent's counterspells. Against all these advantages, you must balance the drawback that the Apprentice works only once it's been under your control all turn--that is, not until the turn after you play it.</P>
