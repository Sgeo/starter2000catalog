<P>Wall of Air is similar to Wall of Swords, but it's 1/5 instead of 3/5 and costs one mana less. Because creature decks tend to be very fast, the tradeoff probably makes Wall of Air the better card of the two. A third-turn Wall of Air may put the creature deck in a lot of trouble, because it can't attack with 1-toughness creatures without losing one of them.</P>
