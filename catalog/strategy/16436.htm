<P>Soldevi Sage can be an amazing card in Sealed-Deck games, where you want to include a lot of lands in your deck so you'll draw them early, but you then end up with too many lands late in the game, when other cards would be more effective. The Sage gives you a way to recycle your land cards; hopefully, the cards you draw can be put to better use.</P>
