<P>Even though you have to take 3 damage to have the Artillery deal 2, it's often worth it. For instance, you might use that 2 damage to kill a creature that was going to deal damage to you every turn, or perhaps the creature you kill is a key blocker, and you'll now be able to attack. Lastly, if your opponent's life total is low enough, trading 3 of your life for 2 of his or hers may be worth it.</P>
