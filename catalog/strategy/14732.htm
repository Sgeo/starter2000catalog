<P>Cities of Brass might appear in "Good Stuff" decks, which use whatever the best creatures and spells are in each color. Such a deck has a little bit of everything: blue counterspelling, red direct damage, green creatures, white for Disenchant, and black to kill creatures. The deck usually has a primary color that it relies on getting early--often green, which allows it to play Birds of Paradise as another way of getting off-color mana.</P>
