<hr>
<P>A control deck generally wants some way to gain life. It's common for an opposing deck to quickly knock the control deck to a low life total, then the control deck stabilizes the situation. The situation is dangerous for the control deck, however, as with its low life total, a single damage spell might defeat it. The control deck can remedy this situation by gaining some life; hence the deck includes one or two Fountains of Youth.<BR>
If you have a Fountain in play, you generally want to gain the life at the end of your opponent's turn unless you need it right away. That is, on your opponent's turn, you wait until he or she is done, then you tap the Fountain and two lands to gain 1 life. That way, your mana is available so that you can play spells in reaction to what your opponent does in case that turns out to be necessary. Even if you don't have any spells you can play, you should still wait on the life gain, because as long as you have cards in hand, your opponent doesn't know whether they're spells you can play, and this possibility might affect his or her play.</P>
