<P>Although Firebreathing can greatly increase a creature's power, it has a severe drawback, namely that you have to spend your mana every turn to do this. If you want to pump your creatures, you'd do better to play an enchantment that lets you pay once and be done with it, such as Giant Strength.</P>
