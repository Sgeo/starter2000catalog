<P>Stalking Tiger is at its best when your opponent has a bunch of smaller creatures. If he or she has three 2/2 creatures, for instance, and you have a Stalking Tiger and another 3/3, then you can attack with the Tiger every turn, leaving the other 3/3 back on defense. If your opponent blocks the Tiger, it will defeat the blocking creature in single combat. If you attacked with the other 3/3, your opponent could double- or triple-block it, and you'd be stuck with a one-for-one card trade.</P>
