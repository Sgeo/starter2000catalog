<P>Regeneration is always a plus, but its usefulness declines rapidly as its mana cost goes up. If you want to play a Gorilla Chieftain and be able to regenerate it immediately, you have to wait until you have six mana. Alternatively, if you play it when you're at four mana and it survives, then on following turns until you play more land, you won't be able to regenerate your Chieftain if you spend more than two mana a turn. This doesn't mean the Chieftain isn't worthwhile, just that a regeneration cost--even a small one--can have a dramatic effect on the game.</P>
