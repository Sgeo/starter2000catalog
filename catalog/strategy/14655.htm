<hr>
<P>Some <B>Magic</B> expansions contain cards that allow you to skip a turn to gain some benefit. These combine nicely with Final Fortune; what you do is skip the Final Fortune turn. Then the end of that turn never happens, so the Fortune's drawback doesn't matter. Another situation Final Fortune is useful in is when you have sorceries you can win the game with, but you're afraid your opponent might counter them. What you do then is wait until your opponent taps out at the end of your turn, expecting to untap immediately afterward, and play Final Fortune in response, thereby gaining a turn when your opponent can't counter your spells. Of course, you'd better be able to win during that extra turn, or else you'll lose.</P>
