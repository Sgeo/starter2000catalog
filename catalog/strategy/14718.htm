<P>Maro's power and toughness are each the same as the number of cards in your hand. This leads to a couple of tricks. When Maro is in play, you should attack before playing land or spells so it deals the maximum amount of damage. After attacking, you should think about whether your cards are worth playing. The +1/+1 bonus each card gives Maro may be more valuable than whatever benefit you get from playing the card.<BR>
If your opponent has a Maro, you may be able to use discard effects to kill it. For instance, if your opponent has two cards and you play Stupor, Maro will die. You should also think about the inhibiting effect Maro can have on your opponent's play. If you have a Terror in hand, you might want to use it right away, or you might want to wait a couple of turns, hoping your opponent will decide not to play spells during that time, in order to keep Maro big. Then when you finally do play Terror on the Maro, you may have a big advantage because your opponent won't have been playing cards.</P>
