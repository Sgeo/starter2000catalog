<P>This card taps all your opponent's lands and empties his or her mana pool. Note that it's <I>not</I> a counterspell; it has no effect on spells that have already been played. Mana Short is most likely to be effective in combination with cards that limit the number of lands a player can untap each turn; these cards are found in many <B>Magic</B> expansions.</P>
