<P>Uktabi Orangutan is one way green can gain card advantage: if you use the Orangutan to get rid of an artifact, your card removes your opponent's card but remains in play itself! Contrast this with playing Disenchant on the artifact, which is a one-for-one trade. (Disenchant has some compensating advantages, but that's another story.) Deciding how to use your Orangutan can be tricky if your opponent doesn't currently have an artifact. Should you play it anyway because it's a 2/2 creature, or should you hang on to it in hopes of using it on an artifact later? You can probably postpone the decision by playing your other creatures first; they're probably better as pure creatures, anyway. In the end, it comes down to risks versus gains: how concerned are you about artifacts in your opponent's deck, and how much faster will you be able to win the game if you play your Orangutan now?</P>
