<P>Verduran Enchantress is a combo card. That is, it's next to useless by itself but can become very powerful in combination with other cards--in this case, enchantments. You should make an all-or-nothing choice for your deck. That is, either you use four Enchantresses and a lot of enchantments to make this is a main point of your deck, or you don't play Enchantresses at all. There's no middle ground.</P>
