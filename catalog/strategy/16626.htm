<hr>
<P>Though black does have several creatures with flying, it isn't as good at that as blue or white is; contrast Bog Imp with Armored Pegasus and Storm Crow, both of which are 1/2 creatures for the same cost. These tradeoffs among the colors are a fundamental aspect of the game: in order to reap the benefits of playing black, such as strong creature-killing cards, you have to put up with its weaknesses, such as weaker flying creatures. One way to get around this is to play multiple colors. This has disadvantages as well, though, such as the danger that you'll draw all lands of one color and none of the other. In <B>Magic</B>, everything is a trade-off, and the best option for your deck isn't usually obvious. This is one reason the game is so fun and interesting.</P>
