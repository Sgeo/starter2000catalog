<P>Meekstone is one way for colors that don't have creature-killing cards, such as blue, to handle big creatures. If you have a Meekstone on the table and a blocker that's 2/3 or so, you're probably in decent shape for creature defense, because the Meekstone means that big creatures can hit you only once, and the blocker will take care of smaller ones.</P>
