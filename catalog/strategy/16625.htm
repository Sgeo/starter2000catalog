<P>In Sealed-Deck play, Feast of the Unicorn can be brutal! You usually put it on a small creature that your opponent can't block for some reason, such as one with landwalk or flying. Suddenly, your 1/1 Shanodin Dryads that was going to win the game for you in twenty turns becomes a 5/1 threat that will win the game if it hits your opponent just four times.</P>
