<P>In Sealed-Deck play, Daraja Griffin is a strong creature: it has flying, and you may be able to use it to kill a creature of your opponent's. The timing of the sacrifice ability can also be used to advantage: you may be able to block with the Griffin, have it assign combat damage, then (even though it might be about to die from your opponent's combat damage) sacrifice it to kill another creature.</P>
