<P>"X" spells are powerful; they can also be tricky to use. For instance, suppose you go first and play a mountain. Your opponent plays a land and a 1/1 creature. On your turn, you have a Blaze in hand, and you have to decide whether to use it to kill the creature. Believe it or not, even though it feels like you're wasting the power of the Blaze when you play it for only 1 damage, this is often worthwhile. That creature may deal a lot of damage to you before you get another way to get rid of it, and you may draw other ways to use your mana effectively in the endgame.</P>
