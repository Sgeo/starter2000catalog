<P>If your deck generates a lot of creatures, Skull Catapult can be great: when a creature is about to die, you sacrifice it to deal 2 damage. In a swarm deck, this can be especially effective later in the game. Your opponent may have ways to stop your creatures from attacking or to kill them before they can attack, but this doesn't stop you from playing Catapult's ability.</P>
