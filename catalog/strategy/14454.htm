<P>If your opponent is playing a direct damage deck, a Venerable Monk can be really annoying. It cancels out some of the damage he or she has dealt to you, and it's a threat as well! It may give you card advantage; for instance, it takes two Shocks to effectively cancel out the gains the Monk has made for you--one to kill the Monk and another to take back the 2 life you gained.</P>
