<P>If you use Reckless Embermage twice in a turn, it will die. But there's nothing to prevent you from using it once during each of your turns and once during each of your opponent's turns. Also, if you decide to have the Embermage blow itself up, you can use it more than twice. It's going to die anyway, so you might as well get as much damage out of it as you can.</P>
