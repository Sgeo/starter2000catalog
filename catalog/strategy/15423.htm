<hr>
<P>A 5/5 creature for four mana is great; having to discard a card at random is a huge drawback. Is it worth it? If your opponent is using direct damage to kill creatures, it probably is; a player who does this probably can't handle a 5/5 creature on turn four, so the Horde will get to attack and deal damage. But if your opponent is playing Terror, Pacifism, or the like, you don't want the Horde, because there's too much risk of giving up two cards for one, and no real gain.</P>
