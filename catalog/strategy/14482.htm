<P>Warmth can really mess up an opposing direct damage deck, as that deck does <I>not</I> want you gaining life! The "tax" of 2 life on every red spell can be crippling for that deck type. It's less effective against red creature spells, though, as you gain life from the spell only once, and after that the creature can deal damage to you every turn.</P>
