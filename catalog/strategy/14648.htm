<P>Fervor is at its strongest when your deck contains creatures with <IMG SRC="../images/tap.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=12 ALT="" BORDER="0"> in their activation costs. For instance, if you play a Prodigal Sorcerer and your opponent immediately plays Terror on it, you've gained nothing. If you have a Fervor on the table, however, you can respond to the Terror by tapping the Sorcerer for 1 damage, possibly killing an enemy creature and enabling you to trade one card for two.</P>
