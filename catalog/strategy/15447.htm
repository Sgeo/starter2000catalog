<P>Once it hits the table, &AElig;ther Flash will shut down a swarm quite effectively; it's even possible that your opponent won't be able to play any creatures at all! Of course, you'll also need direct damage in your deck to get rid of creatures that get out before the Flash does, but because you're playing red, this should be no problem.</P>
