<P>Crusade creates a deck type all its own. Typically, the deck uses thirty to thirty-five one-mana and two-mana white creatures, four Crusades, three or four Armageddons, a few Disenchants, and a couple of creature-killing cards and fills itself out with lands. The idea is to try to win the game quickly, with Crusades making those 1/1 creatures into 2/2s and 3/3s. The deck can deal a lot of damage in a hurry!</P>
