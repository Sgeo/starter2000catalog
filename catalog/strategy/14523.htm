<P>Prodigal Sorcerer is great for wiping out your opponent's 1/1 creatures. Incidentally, a Sorcerer can "win" a battle with a Samite Healer. What you do is tap the Sorcerer to deal 1 damage to the Healer at the end of your opponent's turn. Your opponent can then use the Healer to save itself. The Sorcerer untaps at the start of your turn, and you tap it to deal another 1 damage to the Healer. Because the Healer is now tapped, it can't save itself a second time.</P>
