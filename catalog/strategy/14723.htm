<P>If you're playing Counterspells and the like, you might also want a Svyelunite Temple or two; that way, you can keep only one land untapped and still be in a position to counter your opponent's spell. The cost of this--the sacrifice of the Temple--may or may not be worth it, depending on the situation. Even if you don't have a Counterspell to play, you should still use your other lands before you use your Temple so that your opponent can't tell if you have a counterspell or not. This may cause her to refrain from playing an important spell; she wouldn't know that even if she did play it, you wouldn't be able to do anything about it.</P>
