<hr>
<P>One neat trick is to put Lure on your Thicket Basilisk and attack with it. All your opponent's untapped creatures have to block, and the Basilisk then kills them all. The risk is that if your opponent has a Terror or the like and plays it on your Basilisk, you lose two cards for one. Therefore, it's best to do this when your opponent's lands are all tapped, which reduces the risk of unexpected complications.</P>
