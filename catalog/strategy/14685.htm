<P>If you're playing white, Disenchant is generally a much better way than Tranquility to get rid of enchantments. Disenchant's cheaper mana cost and increased flexibility more than make up for the fact that Tranquility gets rid of all enchantments instead of just one at a time. If you're not playing white, Tranquility may be the only game in town, however, and putting one in your deck is probably far better than being unable to handle enchantments at all.</P>
