<P>If you're building a multicolor deck, you might wonder if the "pain lands" are worth it. That is, would you rather play Underground Rivers and have a better chance of getting the colors of mana you need, or islands and swamps so you won't take damage from your own lands? Most experienced players prefer the pain lands in most situations; being able to play your spells is important enough that it's worth taking some extra damage. The only exception is if your opponent has cards that target your nonbasic lands specifically; in this case, it may be better to play only basic lands.</P>
