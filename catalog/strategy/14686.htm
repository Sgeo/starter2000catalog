<P>The best thing about Elven Cache is its enormous flexibility. Late in the game, you'll have enough different cards in your graveyard that it gives you access to almost everything you're playing. It's particularly useful in slow decks that absolutely must draw a certain "kill" card to win but that don't want to draw that card early in the game. Without a way to get the "kill" card back from your graveyard, you'd have to include extra copies of it in your deck, in case your opponent makes you discard the first one or counters it or it somehow finds its way from your library to your graveyard. This increases the risk that you'll draw the "kill" card early in the game, when you don't want it. But if you have Elven Caches in your deck, you can get away with including only one copy of that card, because if it somehow gets to your graveyard, you can still get it back.</P>
