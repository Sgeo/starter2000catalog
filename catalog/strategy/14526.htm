<P>One of blue's major abilities is the ability to turn its opponent's permanents to its own use. Abduction exemplifies this. If you play it on a creature, you might want to save your counterspells for your opponent's creature-killing spells, because your opponent gets the creature back if it's killed. Alternatively, Abduction can be used to protect your own creature, as the enchanted creature now has two "lives."</P>
