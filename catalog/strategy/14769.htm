<P>Soul Net is similar to the cards that allow you to gain life whenever a spell of a certain color is played. Creatures dying is generally a slightly more common event that someone playing a spell of a specific color, so Soul Net is a slightly better card than those other cards, but that still doesn't make it strong--just not quite as pathetic.</P>
