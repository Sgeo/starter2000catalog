<P>Dragon Mask is useful two ways. The obvious use is to pump your creatures. The less obvious use is to allow you to play your creatures again. For instance, you might use the Mask to pick up a Sengir Autocrat whose tokens are gone. When you play the Autocrat again, you'll get three new tokens. Or you might use the Mask to pick up your creatures, play Wrath of God, then play your creatures again.</P>
