<P>Decisions of whether to attack or stay back on defense are often driven by the power and toughness of available creatures. For instance, if you have a Feral Shadow and your opponent's only creature with flying is 2/2, you're happy to attack with the Shadow: if it's blocked, you'll trade your 2/1 for your opponent's 2/2 and come out ahead in the bargain. By contrast, if your opponent has a 2/2 flying creature and a 1/1 flying creature, you won't want to attack with your Shadow, because you don't want to trade it for a 1/1.</P>
