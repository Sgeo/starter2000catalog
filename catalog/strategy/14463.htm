<P>Disenchant can destroy enchantments or artifacts. This flexibility, combined with the facts that it costs only two mana and is an instant, makes it an extremely strong card. Many decks use four of them. If your opponent is playing a small number of enchantments and artifacts, you may want to use your Disenchants whenever you get the chance. If you see a lot of enchantments and artifacts, however, you might want to think about which one threatens you the most and possibly save your Disenchant to get rid of that one.</P>
