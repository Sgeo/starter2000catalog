<hr>
<P>In creature combat, a creature with first strike works best against a creature it can kill with its own attack, so it doesn't take damage from that creature. For instance, if an Anaba Bodyguard is blocked by two 2/2 creatures, it will kill one of them with its first strike attack. The other will then deal 2 damage to the Bodyguard, which will survive.</P>
