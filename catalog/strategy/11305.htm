<hr>
<P>You often wish you knew what cards are in your opponent's hand. For instance, suppose he or she plays a spell that's annoying to you but not devastating. Should you counter it, or should you save your counter for a more dangerous spell later? It may depend on what else is in your opponent's hand. If those other cards are lands, you're happy to counter the spell, but if they're the cards you really fear, you'll want to save your counter. All this makes the Glasses tempting. But is it really worth it? Instead of playing the Glasses, you could play another Counterspell, Spell Blast, or similar card, which would let you have your cake and eat it too--after countering the medium-strength spell, you'd still have another counter for the really dangerous one.</P>
