<P>Wild Growth can accelerate your mana. That is, if you play a Wild Growth on turn one, you'll have three mana on turn two, not just two. Its big weakness is that you have to play it on a land, and if your opponent destroys the land, you lose the Wild Growth as well. Basically, your opponent's Stone Rains and other land destruction spells have double effect. Wild Growth might still be worth it if you're playing with Verduran Enchantresses, however, which enable you to draw extra cards whenever you play an enchantment. You might also play Wild Growth if you have ways to untap your lands, allowing you to use the enchanted land more than once.</P>
