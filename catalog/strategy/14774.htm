<P>Dingus Egg makes all your land destruction spells deal damage to your opponent in addition to destroying his or her lands. It also works against a deck that sacrifices its lands often. It's difficult to use effectively, however, because if you draw the Egg but no land destruction, it's wasted. If you're playing Armageddons, you might consider not playing the Egg until you're ready to play an Armageddon; if you put the Egg on the table, your opponent will recognize the threat and become more reluctant to play lands.</P>
