<P>If you have a Talruum Minotaur in hand, you probably don't want to play it if it won't have an immediate impact. For instance, suppose you and your opponent both have 3/5 creatures in play. Neither of you can attack effectively, and playing the Minotaur won't change this, so you probably don't want to play it until the situation changes. By keeping it in your hand, you may cause your opponent to misplay. For instance, if you later draw and play a spell to kill your opponent's creature, your opponent might choose not to counter it assuming that you could attack for only 3 damage. The Minotaur could then come as a nasty surprise!</P>
