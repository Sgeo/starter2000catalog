<P>In Sealed-Deck play, artifact creatures are wonderful because you can always play them when you have the appropriate number of lands--that is, you're never hurt because your lands produce the wrong color mana. Furthermore, they're invulnerable to Terror. Obsianus Golem is particularly nice because of its 4/6 stats; though it may or may not be the biggest creature in your deck, it will surely be one of the bigger ones.</P>
