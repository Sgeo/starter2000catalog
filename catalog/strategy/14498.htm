<hr>
<P>Wrath of God is a key card in many defensive decks. The idea is to use this and other cards to kill opposing creatures while building up mana to do something really nasty. Wrath of God is so strong, it can be useful even though it kills your own creatures; killing all opposing creatures can easily be worth it.</P>
