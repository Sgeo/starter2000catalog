<P>Many green decks include one Hurricane. This gives them the ability to kill opposing creatures with flying all at once, and it gives the deck a threat to win the game any time its opponent's life total is low. If you have a Hurricane, your opponent isn't necessarily safe just because he or she can block all your creatures.</P>
