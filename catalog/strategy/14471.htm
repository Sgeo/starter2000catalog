<P>Standing Troops is an excellent defensive creature. Its high toughness makes it a great blocker, and its power of 1 lets it kill small attacking creatures. On top of it all, it doesn't have to tap in order to attack, so if your opponent can't kill it with blockers, you have nothing to lose by attacking with it; you can have your cake and eat it too, as it will still be available to block.</P>
