<P>Circle of Protection: Blue is good against fast blue creature decks, such as Merfolk decks. Blue may be able to handle the Circle of Protection by countering it, but once the Circle hits the table, a blue deck may find it difficult to deal with. Don't use it against white-blue decks, though, as those will just wait for a Disenchant.</P>
