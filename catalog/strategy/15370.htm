<P>Desertion is a Counterspell with a bonus: if the countered spell is an artifact or creature spell, it comes into play on your side. Desertion's drawback, of course, is its higher mana cost. You might want one in your deck, but because of the cost, you surely don't want four. You also need to be a bit careful when you're deciding what card to take, as some artifacts (such as Howling Mine) have the same effect on the game no matter who controls them.</P>
