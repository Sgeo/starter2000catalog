<P>In a normal deck, Summer Bloom isn't worth it. The trouble is that though it does give you a speed boost in the early game, later on it could be a worthless card, as you'll have had plenty of time to play all the lands you want to. If your deck draws a lot of cards, however, it could be a different story. If you're drawing, say, three cards a turn, you're probably drawing more than one land a turn, and you won't be able to play all of them without some kind of accelerator. In this case, Summer Bloom can be extremely worthwhile. This is especially true if your deck includes cards that trigger off playing land, such as Horn of Greed (from the <I>Tempest</I><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> set).</P>
