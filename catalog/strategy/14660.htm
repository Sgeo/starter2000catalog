<hr>
<P>A creature being able to attack and tap the turn it comes under your control is amazingly strong. Often you and your opponent are in a race to deal enough damage in time; the 4 extra damage this ability gives you can easily make the difference between victory and defeat. Also, if your opponent is relying on sorceries (such as Wrath of God) to kill creatures, your Dragon will deal damage at least once before your opponent is able to get rid of it.</P>
