<P>Land destruction decks are tricky to build but can be effective. The idea is that if your opponent doesn't have any land, he or she can't do anything. Use about twenty land destruction spells--you'll have to get some from expansion sets--plus Earthquake and other mass creature destruction. You may also want to use spells that destroy multiple lands at once or repeatable land destruction cards; again, look in expansions for these.</P>
