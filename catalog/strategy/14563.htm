<P>Effects that get cards out of your graveyard cost a bit of mana, but in return you gain flexibility. That is, if you replaced a Raise Dead in your deck with a creature card, you'd have to play <I>that</I> creature when you drew it rather than having your choice of any creature in your graveyard. The big drawback of Raise Dead, however, is that you may not have any creatures in your graveyard when you draw it, in which case the Raise Dead is a worthless card. For this reason, people generally don't put it in their decks.</P>
