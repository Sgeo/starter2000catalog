<P>Manabarbs is one way to handle a Circle of Protection: Red. You still won't be able to deal a lot of damage with an attack, but if your opponent taps a land for mana to prevent the damage, the Manabarbs causes 1 damage to get through. And tapping another land to prevent the Manabarbs damage won't do your opponent any good, because this will just cause the Manabarbs to generate yet another 1 damage.</P>
