<P>Dense Foliage is at its best against black decks. Not only do those decks typically have a lot of spell cards that target your creatures, but they also generally can't get rid of enchantments, so the Foliage will by in play to stay! The only problem is that black can still play Perish to kill off all your green creatures, so the best situation to play the Foliage is where many of your creatures are artifact creatures or are some other color.</P>
