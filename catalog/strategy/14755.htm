<P>Like Disenchant, Pillage is an excellent card because of its flexibility. You might include it in your deck as your way of dealing with artifacts, and if it turns out your opponent isn't playing artifacts, that's okay, because you can always play the Pillage on a land instead. Pillage also works wonderfully in a land destruction deck; there, the primary use is destroying land, but if there's an artifact you really need to get rid of, you can play the Pillage on that instead.</P>
