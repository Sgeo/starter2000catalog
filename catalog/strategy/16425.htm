<P>One use of Healing Salve is to "save" a creature. For instance, if your opponent tries to destroy a creature with Shock, you can use Healing Salve to keep it from being destroyed. If you're going to use the Salve to gain 3 life, you might want to wait until your opponent tries to kill you. This could cause your opponent to make a mistake; for instance, he or she might sacrifice several creatures, expecting to deal you enough damage to win, only to have you gain 3 life with the Salve instead.</P>
