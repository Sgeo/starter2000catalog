<P>If you come across a Mana Prism in Sealed Deck, you'll probably include it in your deck in a heartbeat. The reason is that you're usually playing only five or six lands in each of your colors, so it's easy to end up not drawing any lands in one color for a long time, with devastating effects on your chances of winning. A Mana Prism means that you can still play cards in a color you don't draw.</P>
