<P>If you have a Mesa Falcon on the table, you should be careful about how you manage your mana. For instance, if you could tap either a forest or a plains to pay for the colorless part of some spell, you might want to tap the forest so that the plains is available to pump the Falcon in case that becomes necessary.</P>
