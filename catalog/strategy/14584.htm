<P>If you have enough mana, Mind Warp can force your opponent to discard his or her entire hand! Getting there can be difficult, though: in order to play a big Mind Warp, you first have to survive the early game. This isn't likely to be easy, especially if a lot of your cards are dedicated to building up your mana so you can play the Mind Warp.</P>
