<P>If you play a Psychic Transfer, you want to get the maximum gain possible from it by ensuring that your life total is exactly 5 lower than your opponent's. This may even include intentionally giving yourself mana burn to reduce your life total. If your opponent is playing a red deck, look out--it wouldn't do to get 5 life down, play Psychic Transfer, then have your opponent play Shock so that you're 7 life behind and the Transfer has no effect.</P>
