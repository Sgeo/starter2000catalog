<P>Memory Lapse is a variant on Counterspell. It's slightly easier to play, but it puts the spell back on top of your opponent's deck, so your opponent will presumably draw the card again next turn. This makes it best in situations where your opponent is using nonrenewable resources, such as mana sources that don't untap as normal and sacrifices, to pay for the spell. It's also useful in decks that are playing only a small amount of blue and need some counterspelling to briefly protect themselves while they do some "trick."</P>
