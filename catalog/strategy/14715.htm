<P>Nature's Resurgence is green's answer to opposing decks that kill its creatures off. If your opponent is playing a red deck that uses spells to kill your creatures, for example, he or she is likely to be getting a card advantage--until you play a Nature's Resurgence, that is, drawing eight cards for the eight creatures in your graveyard, while your opponent, whose graveyard has mostly spells in it, draws only two cards.</P>
